# tg-export-analysis

This repository analyzes exported Telegram conversations to identify leads or prospects who stopped responding. The goal is to generate follow-up reports so we can re-engage and recover dropped conversations.

## Features

- Parses Telegram JSON export data
- Identifies participants and message gaps
- Highlights last response date and unanswered follow-ups
- Generates actionable reports for outreach

## How to Export Telegram Data

1. Open **Telegram Desktop**.
2. Go to **Settings → Advanced → Export Telegram data**.
3. Configure the export:
   - **Uncheck**: *Photos*, *Story archive*
   - **Check**: *Personal chats*, *Private groups*
   - Under *Private groups*, **uncheck**: *Only my messages*
   - Under *Location and format*, select: **Machine-readable JSON**
4. Click **Export**, then download when ready.

Place the resulting `result.json` file into this project directory.

Run the report generator:

```
python generate_followups_report.py

Review the output to identify follow-up opportunities.
